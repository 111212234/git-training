3. Push the branch and set upstream.
4. Show again the history with information about which branch on which commit is placed.
5. Merge your branch into master.

Okay, that was easy, eh.


## Remote branches and merging

2. Create local tracking branch for **origin/release-1.0**.
3. Merge in the local branch **release-1.0** the branch **origin/feature33**.
4. Check the history with showing the diverging commits. Are there any? Compare the local branch **release-1.0** and its upstream remote tracking branch.
5. Push the changes and check the history again.
